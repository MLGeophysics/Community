# MLGeophysics Community

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MLGeophysics/community.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MLGeophysics/community)

This repository hosts a wiki for Machine Learning in Geophysics. This repository
is maintained by a group of researchers at the Colorado School of Mines interested
in applying machine learning to geophysical investigations.

Head over to [**the website**](https://mlgeophysics.github.io/community) to learn more!


To serve the website locally, use the command:

```sh
$ python -m mkdocs serve
```

(We do this because we have custom plugins that needed to be loaded from the current working directory)
