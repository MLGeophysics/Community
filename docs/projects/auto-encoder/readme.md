# Autoencoders 

Autoencoders can be used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, cluster, denoise, interpolate, separate signals, and perform many nifty digital signal processing techniques.  Examples of how to build, train, and utilize autoencoders are collected here.  For now, we just have a simple 1D sequence to sequence autoencoder for denoising monochromatic signals.
