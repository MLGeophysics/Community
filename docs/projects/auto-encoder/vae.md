# Variational Autoencoders 

Variational autoencoders view autoencoding from a statistical perspective. Like classical autoencoders, they encode a dataset into a lower dimensional latent space. Additionally, though, variational autoencoders constrain the encoded vectors to roughly follow a probability distribution, e.g. a normal distribution. Here's an example of a variational autoencoder for the same 1D sequence to sequence monochromatic signal encoding problem.
