# 2019 February 25 
## Location: Coors Tech 

**Attending**:  
--------------
Thomas Iga Jihyun Bane Hayden Andy Antoine   

**Key takeaways**  
-----------------  
* Hayden has lots of feedback in the comments.   

**Problems**  
------------------------  
* Hayden has a ridiculously high number of feature dimensions   
* How to validate with low number of wells?  
* If trained successfully, would a model from here work in the field?  

**Comments**  
----------------------------  
* Polar coordinate interpolation to avoid nans   
* PCA to reduce dimensionality  
* Multi-dimensional scaling for data dimensionality reduction  
* Check error on slide 4 (normalize between -1 and 1)  
* A super low training loss may indicate over training.   
* Consider cross-validating across wells **and** models per well.  
* A dropout layer may help you reduce over training.  
* Consider leveraging spatial correlation with convolutional layers.  
* Space filling curves may help reorder cells into an ordered 1D sequence.  
* Consider autoencoding data then training network (alternative to PCA).  
* Consider intelligently selecting validation set (not randomly).  

**Topics of discussion for next week**      
----------------------------------    
* Bin will discuss his project and get feedback
