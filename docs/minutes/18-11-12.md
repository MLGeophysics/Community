TODO:
-----
- Begin compiling VAE summary (Iga, Andy, Thomas)   
- Begin compiling PyTorch vs. Keras materials (Jihyun)   

**Problem**  
------------------------  
* Bane has a ton of hydro flow models and corresponding data.     
* What geophysical data is most appropriate for detecting flow?    
* Does not have access to flow simulator.   

**Questions**   
-------------------------   
* This looks like a sensitivity analysis?   
* What variogram was used to generate your models?   

**Comments**    
----------------------------  
* Speed up flow simulation for this particular.   
* Explore how NN performs compared to flow inversion (see Joe C. PhD thesis)   
* Train NN with current model+flow.   
* Recurrent NN seems appropriate.   
* You could generate more models for testing if you had the variogram.   
* "Simplify to a point that is easy to generalize from." -AG  


**Website changes**  
-----------  
* Projects tab (coming soon)  
* Jupyter notebook on website?  (coming soon)  


**Topics of discussion for next week**      
----------------------------------    
- Touch on VAEs    

Upcoming/backup topics of discussion     
------------------------------------  
- Variational Auto-encoders summary and application (Iga, Andy, and Thomas)   
- Arnab - existing project   
- PyTorch vs. Keras
