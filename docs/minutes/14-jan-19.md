# 14 January 2019
## Location: Coors Tech 

Attending:  
Andy Antoine Thomas Iga Jihyun Bane   

**Key takeaways**  
-----------------  
* Alexi has Kafadar DAS dataset  
* Jihyun and Jeff S. have dam seismic data  
* Jihyun, Thomas, Iga are down to work on LANL Kaggle competition >=1hr/wk   

**Problems**  
------------------------  
* Jihyun - dispersion curve analysis for anomaly detection in dams   
* Iga - separate engine noise from seismic data   
* Andy - extend GAN+inversion application to 1D well logs and 1D inversion (MT?)  
* Bane - still formulating the problem with huge amount of flow data.   

**Questions**   
-------------------------   

**Comments**  
----------------------------  
* Maybe structural analysis literature has ML-based anomaly detection for Jihyun.  
* Bane may try finding (1) which wells will leak, or (2) depth to leak, or (3) time since leak.  

**Topics of discussion for next week**      
----------------------------------    
* LANL Kaggle competition data overview and preliminary results  

**Upcoming/backup topics of discussion**      
----------------------------------------  
* Kaggle competition paper discussion
