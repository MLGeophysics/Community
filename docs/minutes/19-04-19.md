# 2019 April 8  
## Location: Coors Tech 

**Attending**:  
--------------
Iga Jihyun Andy Antoine Bin Julian Bane Thomas 

**Key takeaways**  
-----------------  
* Tensorflow officially suppports Keras  
* Tensorflow has new probablistic and open data distribuition tools  
* EDAA is a more formal group for us to potentially present/participate in  
* We now have nice, clean, open, RILD well log data from Kansas  
* Andy has impressive GAN puns.

**Problems**  
------------------------  
* Is 4000 wells enough to properly train a GAN?  
* Is Tensorflow's official embedding of Keras better than Keras?  
* What are the unites of the well data?  

**Comments**  
----------------------------  
* **Slides for TF updates are on Slack**
* **Slides for EDAA are on Slack**  
* **Well log data for GAN (open data cleaned by Andy)**
	* 4000 wells  
	* 400 - 4000 ft 
	* 1 ft spacing in depth 
	* x-y coordinates of wells not in file, but available  
	* Data is RILD (MT-like)   
	* RILD ranges over several orders of magnitude  
	* We should use log(RILD) as inputs  
	* All well logs are from Kansas  
	* "Let's build the best GAN we can." - Andy  
	* "All we need is a good G." - Andy  
	* Downsampled by linear averaging every 60 ft.  
	* 3600 samples per well (full resolution)  
	* 60 samples per well (downsampled)  
	* 100 MB file (full resolution link pending) 
	* 2 MB file (downsampled on Slack)  
* Meeting didn't go as planned timeline, too much in the meeting  

**Topics of discussion for next week**      
----------------------------------    
* Breaking into three groups for pair programming of GAN   
* Two groups for network structure: Andy, Bin, Julian, Iga, Jihyun    
* One group for data viz: Thomas + Bane
