## Create a Conda Virtual Environment

Thomas discussed best practices for managing Python packages and recommends nestling all used packages in local Python virtual environments. Thomas highly recommends not using system wide installations.

Example conda virtual environment:

```bash
$ conda create -n mlgp python=3.6

$ conda activate mlgp

(mlgp) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

# install whatever you want via pip

```

## Get Started with Kerras and TensorFlow

Thomas recommends using Kerras with a TensorFlow backend. Keras is easy to use

`ImageDateGenerator` from Keras lets you augment images. Use `fit_generator` when using `ImageDataGenerator`

## U-Net

Achieved an accuracy of 78% on validation set. Incorporating seismic attributes may increase accuracy

Image scaling is important.
