## Location: Coors Tech 

**Attending**:  
--------------
Jihyun Andy Thomas 

**Key takeaways**  
-----------------  
* Preparing a paper on training a generator on well log data
* Possible participants: Andy, Thomas, Jihyun, Bin, Bane
* Well-defined scope, open access publication

**Problems**  
------------------------  
* Data needs to be better cleaned
* Identify other potential well data types besides resistivity
* Check the units of the well data  

**Comments**  
----------------------------  
* **Scope of paper**  
	* Stick to CNN-based GAN
	* Multi-dimensional training data
* **Motivation**
	* lack of geosci training data
	* well logs are simple and high fidelity
        * simple geometry
        * ubiquitous
	        * oil,water,mining
	* generator
	    * no petro-phys model/simulator
	    * act as a prior for inversion
	        * mention gradients?
	    * links different types of logs
	    * well log data recovery 
	    * unsupervised 
* **Outline of paper**
* Intro
    * Geology of Kansas
    * GAN
    * Lit review
        * Background on Kansas geology
* Methods
    * experiment/ data
    * QC/data cleaning
    * GAN
    * Cross-validation
        * spatial stats
        * wavelet transform
        * Fourier transform
        * PCA
* Results
    * what the clean data looks like
    * short
    * no interp
    * speed
        * training
        * generating
    * statistics
        * cross-validation based on location
    * visualizing well log plots
* Discussion
    * each result item
        * compare speed vs other methods
        * What did/didn't the network learn
    * speculation
    * recommendations
    * predictions/future work
* **Contributions of paper**
    * published curated dataset
    * published trained network
    * Discussion
* **Task breakdown**
    * Thomas: statistical analysis
    * Jihyun: Gan literature review
    * Andy: Data cleaning
        * may need help
        * Download zipped las files from KGS (link on mlgp website)
        * check units: depth and Ohm-m
        * Do our best to handle well geometry
        * ID Nans
        * Handle NaNs
        * ID most popular aliases
        * write functions in .py file
        * Function 1
            * takes: a well log, mneumonic
            * returns mask for nan, depth
        * Function 2
            * takes: data, mask, depths
            * returns: 'clean' data
        * Interpolate over no more than 10 ft
* Split paper off from ML group?
    * We'll see what interests people have
* Hani's like a Pokemon, We gotta catch em.

**Agenda for next week**      
----------------------------------    
* Clean data
* Set up communication channels for collaborating over summer
* Go get a burger
