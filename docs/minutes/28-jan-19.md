**Attending**:  
--------------
Thomas Iga Jihyun Bane Rosie   

**Key takeaways**  
-----------------  
* Jihyun got an MSE of 1.5-ish in the Kaggle competition (top 200)   
* Rosie is working on a cool 2D CNN senior design project for fault detection   
* Jihyun will give a brief tutorial on boosting next week   

**Problems**  
------------------------  
* Rosie - getting started with fault detection  
* Thomas - how can we scale LANL project features without precomputing them?  

**Comments**  
----------------------------  
* Rosie is working with 3D migrated DAS images  
* Her inputs are two different migrated images from active and passive sources  
* Her output is a fault map/volume  
* She could try a 2D CNN in Keras to start   
* LANL Kaggle kernels precompute features before deriving scaling   

**Topics of discussion for next week**      
----------------------------------    
* Boosting tutorial from Jihyun
