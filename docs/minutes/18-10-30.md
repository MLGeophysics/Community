## Location: GRLA 107 

Group members discussed Hayden's project, which involves making decisions when provided a large number of earth models from a stochastic inversion.  An outline of conversation content is below.  Based on the meeting, we need to provide a tiny bit more structure to the one-slide conversation starters to bring focus towards the ML aspects of projects.     

Attending:
Andy Thomas Iga Jihyun Arnab Hayden Jonah

TODO:  
-----
- Decide on a different meeting time using a Doodle poll (Jihyun) 
- Add Naive Bayes to Resources tab (Hayden)   
- Email website version of slide as a pdf to Thomas (Hayden)  
- Provide slide content guidelines to focus on ML aspects in meetups (Thomas)  

Making decisions using a suite of stochastically inverted earth models (Hayden)
------
**Goal**:  "When provided many earth models that all fit data, how do we make a decision?"   
**Input**:  Rock properties: density, p-velocity, s-velocity, and porosity   
**Framework**:  Naive Bayes Binary Classifier   
**Output**:  High vs. low producer classification   
**Details**:  
- Stochastic inversion input: rock physics model + amplitude-vs-offset  
- Initial labels derived from user-defined production-based cutoff  
- Many statistical assumptions in stochastic inversion framework  
**Problems**:  
- Consistent misclassifcation near faults.  
- Dimensionality reduction problems.  
**Questions**:  
- How does Naive Bayes work?  
- What are the statistical assumptions in the inversion?  Are they violated by Naive Bayes?  
**Deltas**:  
- Consider exploring which of the 5,000 models predicts best?   
- Consider using other classification algorithms RF, SVM, ...   
- Consider using smaller number of rock properties as inputs to lower dimensionality
