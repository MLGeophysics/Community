**Attending**  
--------------
Jihyun Andy Thomas Antoine Bin Iga 

**Key takeaways**  
-----------------  
* The well log GAN project to be a tutorial-like paper in Geophysics  
* Well log GAN peeps will meet weekly over the summer (TBD)  
* In-person meetings to resume on campus in Fall semester  

**Problems**  
------------------------  
* Data still needs to be better cleaned
* Identify other potential well data types besides resistivity
* Check the units of the well data  
* Hani's like a Pokemon, We gotta catch em.

**Updated notes on well log paper**  
----------------------------  
* **Scope of paper**  
	* Stick to CNN-based GAN  
	* Multi-dimensional training data after 1D success  
	* Tone is tutorial-like  
* **Motivation**
	* lack of geosci training data
	* well logs are simple and high fidelity
	* ubiquitous
	* oil,water,mining
	* generator
	* no petro-phys model/simulator
	* act as a prior for inversion
		* mention gradients?
	* links different types of logs
	* well log data recovery 
	* unsupervised 
* **Contributions of paper**
    * published curated dataset
    * published trained network
    * GAN tutorial  
    * foothold into further GAN work  
* **Outline of paper**
	* Intro
	    * Geology of Kansas - *postpone to Fall* 
	    * GAN background - Andy, Jihyun, Bin, and Iga  
	    * RILD background - Andy  
	* Methods
	    * QC/data cleaning - Andy
	    * GAN - Andy, Jihyun, Bin, and Iga   
	    * Cross-validation - Thomas
		* spatial stats
		* wavelet transform
		* Fourier transform
		* PCA
	* Results
	    * QC/data cleaning - Andy
	    * GAN - Andy, Jihyun, Bin, and Iga   
	    * Cross-validation - Thomas
		* spatial stats
		* wavelet transform
		* Fourier transform
		* PCA
	* Discussion
	    * each result item
	    * Answer: What did/didn't the network learn
	    * speculation on use cases  
	    * recommendations for changes  
	    * predictions/future work
* **Task leader breakdown**
    * Jihyun: Gan literature review
    * Thomas: statistical analysis
    * Andy: Data cleaning
        * may need help
        * Download zipped las files from KGS (link on mlgp website)
        * check units: depth and Ohm-m
        * Do our best to handle well geometry
        * ID Nans
        * Handle NaNs
        * ID most popular aliases
        * write functions in .py file
        * Function 1
            * takes: a well log, mneumonic
            * returns mask for nan, depth
        * Function 2
            * takes: data, mask, depths
            * returns: 'clean' data
        * Interpolate over no more than 10 ft

**Agenda for next meeting**      
----------------------------------    
* Go get a burger
* Communicate work done over the summer  
* Line up potential speakers from GP department for the fall
